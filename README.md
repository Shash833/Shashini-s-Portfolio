# Shashini's Portfolio
 
## Introduction:
This portfolio was created to provide an online platform to introduce myself and showcase projects I have completed. 
The website was structured to be compatible on both computer browsers and mobile phones with use of Bootstrap and Media Queries.
 
The portfolio can be viewed on: https://shash833.github.io/Shashini-s-Portfolio/
 
## Technologies:
* HTML: 
 
    Three HTML files were created to form the structure of this website: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
    These files were linked to each other within the navigation bar. 
 
* CSS:
 
    Three CSS files were created to be linked to corresponding HTML files. 
    Media Queries were also used within each CSS file to help improve the layout of the website on smaller screens.
 
* Bootstrap:
 
    To help structure the website and to allow it to become mobile responsive, the bootstrap grid system was used to organise elements within rows and columns. 
 
    The following link was added to use the Bootstrap stylesheet in this project:
    ```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
        integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">
    ```
 
* Google Fonts
 
    The font "Cedarville Cursive" was obtained from Google Fonts and was used in the website's headings and subheadings.
    The following link was added to use the font style in this project:
    ```
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cedarville+Cursive&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    ```
